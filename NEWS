2011-12-06:
- Version 0.1.1
- [Dev] Adapted the database-related source code to the new SOCI-3.1 API.
- [Build] Improved the CMake build framework. For instance, the package
  versions are now correctly handled, for the simulator-related components,
  as well as for third-party libraries (e.g., Xapian, SOCI, Boost). The
  rpath/run-path is now inserted into the (library, executable) binaries
  (only when needed, though).
- [Build] Removed any support for the GNU Autotools.
