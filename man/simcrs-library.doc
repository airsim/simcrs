	  C++ Simulated Travel-Oriented Distribution System Library

\section sec_synopsis SYNOPSIS

\code
#include <simcrs/...>
\endcode

\section sec_description DESCRIPTION

SimCRS aims at providing a clean API and a simple implementation, as a
C++ library, of a Travel-oriented Distribution System. It corresponds
to the simulated version of the real-world Computerized Reservation
Systems (CRS).

SimCRS makes an extensive use of existing open-source libraries for
increased functionality, speed and accuracy. In particular the Boost
(C++ Standard Extensions: http://www.boost.org) library is used.

The library covers the following areas:
- Schedule (flight-periods) parsing and management:
  travel solution finding
- Inventory (flight-dates) parsing and management:
  availability calculation and sell management
- Pricing
- Distributed airline inventories
- Codeshare and alliances
