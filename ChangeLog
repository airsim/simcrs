* Tue Dec 06 2011 Denis Arnaud <denis_arnaud at users dot sourceforge dot net> 0.1.1
- [Dev] Adapted the database-related source code to the new SOCI-3.1 API.
- [Build] Improved the CMake build framework. For instance, the package
versions are now correctly handled, for the simulator-related components, as
well as for third-party libraries (e.g., Xapian, SOCI, Boost). The
rpath/run-path is now inserted into the (library, executable) binaries (only
when needed, though).
- [Build] Removed any support for the GNU Autotools.

* Wed Nov 23 2011 Denis Arnaud <denis_arnaud at users dot sourceforge dot net> 0.1.0
- First release
